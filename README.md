# Play2048 automation

These are automated tests written for app [Play2048](https://play2048.co). ests are written using Selenium framework and Java programming language. As a testing framework I have used TestNG, and tests are organized on the basis of POM (Page Object Model).
As a reporting tool I have used Allure. Project build tool that I have used to streamline project file organization is Maven. Main browser used for running tests was Google Chrome version 114 and 115. Tests also work on Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox browsers.
